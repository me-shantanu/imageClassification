### How to Install-
 $ pip install --upgrade pip
  # Current stable release for CPU and GPU
 $ pip install tensorflow
 # Or try the preview build (unstable)
 $ pip install tf-nightly


### Keras -
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
